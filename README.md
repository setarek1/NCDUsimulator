NCDUsimulator
in this C project we are simulating NCDU using a multi-threaded program. we are monitoring files within a given directory.
all the threads and proccesses that are made in the program will be shown in the terminal. the files that are monitored will also be shown.
at the end we get the total size of the directory, the largest file and the smallest file in the directoty.
